Level-1:
Customized web page with new images and color scheme.
Used D3Js populate unfiltered data. On initial landing the page display's unfiltered data
Used D3Js to listen filter button click. The event listner will filter the sightings by date if a date is entered. If no date is entered and the filter button is clicked then the event listner will not filter and will display unfiltered data.
Note: Date needs to be excat for a match and should be in "m/d/yyyy" format. A string comparision is performed. DateTime comparision will need to be looked at when time permits

Level-2:
Level-1 was modified to include addtional filters. Since there was only 111 records, dropdowns where used for all filters.
Used D3Js to filter data. Implemented If else and found by rearch that javascript || operator can be used for handling empty filter values.
Note: City, State, country drop downs are not intuitive and could be made to cascade using D3Js when time permits though not a requirement!
